# How to get the game running

1. Fork this repository and rename it when forking to the name that you want

2. Find the `.swf` file for the game that you want (can usually be found by searching on github), and download it

3. Find the logo for the game that you want, and download it

4. Upload both files to your forked copy of the repository

5. Edit `index.html` with the changes such as inputting the game name, logo, and swf file name

6. Go to the repo's Settings/Pages and make the Github pages source the master root of the repository

7. Wait for github to get your website up

That's it...
